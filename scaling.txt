suppose you are the fortunate sufferer of a good problem which is that your website all of a sudden is super 
popular and this website has maybe some static web content, HTML files, gifs, and the like, dynamic content 
like PHP code, maybe even some database stuff, maybe some database stuff like MySQL. Well, how do you go about 
scaling your site so that it can handle more users? 

Answer:
The most straightforward approach is generally what's called "Vertical Scaling", 
vertical in the sense that -- well, if you're running low on RAM or you're 
kind of exhausting your available CPU cycles or you're running low on disc 
space, what's the easiest, most obvious solution to that problem? 
Get a better processor and more RAM.
